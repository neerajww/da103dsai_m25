title: Lecture 05 | From Human Perception to Machine Learning
tldr: Introduction to Machine Learning The core of the lecture introduces the fundamental concept of machine learning using a practical example. Students were asked to guess the height, weight, and age of a person in an image. The collected data revealed real-world challenges like inconsistent units and missing values, which led to a discussion on data pre-processing. The instructor then used the relationship between height and weight to introduce the concept of learning. The goal was to find a simple linear model, f(x)=Ax, that could predict a person's weight from their height. The process of finding the unknown value, A, by minimizing the error between the model's prediction and the actual data is what's defined as "learning" in this context. The instructor explained that this minimization can be achieved through methods like a grid search and contrasted this practical, engineering-focused view of learning with the more abstract philosophical views of dualism and materialism. The person in the image was revealed to be Indian athlete Murali Sreeshankar.
