title: Lecture 01 | A Global and Historical Perspective
tldr: The Grand Narrative of AI- The lecture masterfully places AI within the long arc of human development. By connecting the evolution of human communication—from smoke signals and writing to the internet—with the history of computation from Charles Babbage to Alan Turing, the instructor positions AI not as a new phenomenon, but as the latest stage in our ongoing quest to process information and extend our intelligence beyond the human mind. The Reality of AI vs. the Hype - A significant highlight is the instructor's deliberate strategy of building up the students' excitement with impressive examples of AI, such as a Roomba's navigation, an algorithm that can predict protein folding, and generative AI that creates hyper-realistic faces. This is then immediately followed by a crucial reality check a demonstration where the AI tool fails to generate a one-horned rhino. This moment is impactful because it forces a critical discussion, teaching the students to question and understand the limitations of AI rather than just being impressed by its capabilities. The Importance of Foundational and Soft Skills - The lecture goes beyond technical content to emphasize the importance of non-technical skills. By citing a World Economic Forum report and the growing relevance of curiosity and lifelong learning, the instructor sends a powerful message that success in the field of AI and data science requires more than just coding knowledge. The lecture encourages a holistic approach to learning, urging students to be inquisitive and to connect with other domains, highlighting that AI is a tool to solve problems across various fields.
