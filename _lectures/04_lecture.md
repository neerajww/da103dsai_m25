title: Lecture 04 | Perception, Cognition, and Intelligence
tldr: The lecture begins by discussing low-resource languages that are on the verge of extinction. The instructor points out that when a language disappears, so does the unique knowledge associated with it. This poses a challenge for AI development, as building models like ChatGPT for these languages requires a community of speakers and extensive data. Perception vs. Cognition - A central theme is the distinction between perception and cognition. Perception is the initial process of taking in raw sensory signals and turning them into meaningful patterns. The instructor highlights humans' impressive perceptual abilities, like recognizing a face in dim light or identifying a voice's gender. Cognition is the higher-level mental process that uses these perceived patterns to reason, make decisions, and learn. An example is not just hearing a sound (perception), but understanding the emotion behind it (cognition). The lecture also touches on multi-sensory perception, where the brain combines input from different senses to get a more complete picture. The Mind, Brain, and Evolution - The lecture touches on the philosophical debate of dualism vs. materialism regarding the mind. The materialist view, which is the foundation of AI and neuroscience, holds that the mind is a product of the physical brain. This means learning involves physical changes in the brain's neural connections, a process that can be modeled. The lecture also briefly discusses the evolution of the brain, from simple organisms like jellyfish to more complex bilateral animals, suggesting that understanding this evolution can provide insights for designing intelligent systems.
