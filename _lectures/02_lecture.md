title: Lecture 02 | What Does It Mean to Be Intelligent?
tldr: The lecture emphasized a critical mindset for aspiring AI engineer - rather than just being impressed by what an AI system can do, they must actively seek out where and why it fails. The instructor used the example of the one-horned rhino to illustrate this point, arguing that a system's true robustness is proven only when its limitations are understood and addressed. This core principle was compared to the rigorous testing of real-world engineering projects like airplanes and bridges. A significant portion of the lecture was dedicated to deconstructing the terms "intelligence" and "learning." Learning was defined as "gaining useful information" or, more abstractly, "building a model of the outside world." Intelligence was presented as a "suitcase word," meaning it encompasses a wide range of abilities and has no single, fixed definition. It was framed as a spectrum, not a binary switch, and the definition was shown to be highly dependent on context, changing over time as problems are solved (e.g., a chess-playing computer was once considered a peak of AI, but no longer is). The lecture also challenged the notion that a brain is essential for intelligence, citing the adaptive behaviors of plants.The lecture highlighted the importance of communication and signals as a foundation for intelligence. Using examples from ants, chimpanzees, and humans, the instructor explained how different species have evolved various modalities—from pheromones and facial expressions to spoken language—to transmit and receive information. This discussion served as a prelude to exploring the physical basis of perception, such as how human eyes are only capable of sensing a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum.
