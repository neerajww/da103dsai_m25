        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture 01 | A Global and Historical Perspective</span><br>

        <strong>About:</strong> The Grand Narrative of AI- The lecture masterfully places AI within the long arc of human development. By connecting the evolution of human communication—from smoke signals and writing to the internet—with the history of computation from Charles Babbage to Alan Turing, the instructor positions AI not as a new phenomenon, but as the latest stage in our ongoing quest to process information and extend our intelligence beyond the human mind. The Reality of AI vs. the Hype - A significant highlight is the instructor's deliberate strategy of building up the students' excitement with impressive examples of AI, such as a Roomba's navigation, an algorithm that can predict protein folding, and generative AI that creates hyper-realistic faces. This is then immediately followed by a crucial reality check a demonstration where the AI tool fails to generate a one-horned rhino. This moment is impactful because it forces a critical discussion, teaching the students to question and understand the limitations of AI rather than just being impressed by its capabilities. The Importance of Foundational and Soft Skills - The lecture goes beyond technical content to emphasize the importance of non-technical skills. By citing a World Economic Forum report and the growing relevance of curiosity and lifelong learning, the instructor sends a powerful message that success in the field of AI and data science requires more than just coding knowledge. The lecture encourages a holistic approach to learning, urging students to be inquisitive and to connect with other domains, highlighting that AI is a tool to solve problems across various fields.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture 02 | What Does It Mean to Be Intelligent?</span><br>

        <strong>About:</strong> The lecture emphasized a critical mindset for aspiring AI engineer - rather than just being impressed by what an AI system can do, they must actively seek out where and why it fails. The instructor used the example of the one-horned rhino to illustrate this point, arguing that a system's true robustness is proven only when its limitations are understood and addressed. This core principle was compared to the rigorous testing of real-world engineering projects like airplanes and bridges. A significant portion of the lecture was dedicated to deconstructing the terms "intelligence" and "learning." Learning was defined as "gaining useful information" or, more abstractly, "building a model of the outside world." Intelligence was presented as a "suitcase word," meaning it encompasses a wide range of abilities and has no single, fixed definition. It was framed as a spectrum, not a binary switch, and the definition was shown to be highly dependent on context, changing over time as problems are solved (e.g., a chess-playing computer was once considered a peak of AI, but no longer is). The lecture also challenged the notion that a brain is essential for intelligence, citing the adaptive behaviors of plants.The lecture highlighted the importance of communication and signals as a foundation for intelligence. Using examples from ants, chimpanzees, and humans, the instructor explained how different species have evolved various modalities—from pheromones and facial expressions to spoken language—to transmit and receive information. This discussion served as a prelude to exploring the physical basis of perception, such as how human eyes are only capable of sensing a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture 03 | From Signals to Data</span><br>

        <strong>About:</strong> The Intelligence Continuum-The lecture defined intelligence not as a binary concept but as a continuum or continuous function. This continuum is broken down into three levels. Reflexive Intelligence-The most basic, deeply ingrained evolutionary responses, like pulling your hand away from something hot. Learned Behavior- A more complex form that requires data and experience, such as a face recognition system. Superintelligent AI- The theoretical, ultimate level of intelligence that surpasses human capabilities, which students suggested could be exemplified by a tool like ChatGPT due to its vast knowledge and non-defensive responses. Signals vs. Data- A Critical Distinction - A core concept introduced was the precise distinction between a signal and data. A signal was defined as an "observable change in a quantifiable entity" that exists continuously in nature. In contrast, data is the discrete measurement or recording of that signal. This highlights that data is not an exact replica of a signal but a potentially flawed representation, as shown through the detailed example of measuring room temperature. The instructor also explained that research papers are a means for researchers to share new ideas and theories with the wider scientific community. Perception, Communication, and Language Diversity - The lecture explored sensory perception by comparing the hearing ranges of different species (e.g., humans, bats, elephants, dolphins). The instructor emphasized that a species' ability to perceive a certain frequency range is closely tied to its ability to produce sounds in that same range, suggesting an evolutionary link between perception and communication. This led to a discussion on the diversity of spoken languages on Earth. The lecture used a world map to illustrate that the high density of languages in some regions (like near the equator and in Northeast India) is often a result of geographical barriers like mountains and islands, which isolate communities and allow distinct languages to develop. This diversity of language presents a significant challenge and a new frontier for AI development.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lecture 04 | Perception, Cognition, and Intelligence</span><br>

        <strong>About:</strong> The lecture begins by discussing low-resource languages that are on the verge of extinction. The instructor points out that when a language disappears, so does the unique knowledge associated with it. This poses a challenge for AI development, as building models like ChatGPT for these languages requires a community of speakers and extensive data. Perception vs. Cognition - A central theme is the distinction between perception and cognition. Perception is the initial process of taking in raw sensory signals and turning them into meaningful patterns. The instructor highlights humans' impressive perceptual abilities, like recognizing a face in dim light or identifying a voice's gender. Cognition is the higher-level mental process that uses these perceived patterns to reason, make decisions, and learn. An example is not just hearing a sound (perception), but understanding the emotion behind it (cognition). The lecture also touches on multi-sensory perception, where the brain combines input from different senses to get a more complete picture. The Mind, Brain, and Evolution - The lecture touches on the philosophical debate of dualism vs. materialism regarding the mind. The materialist view, which is the foundation of AI and neuroscience, holds that the mind is a product of the physical brain. This means learning involves physical changes in the brain's neural connections, a process that can be modeled. The lecture also briefly discusses the evolution of the brain, from simple organisms like jellyfish to more complex bilateral animals, suggesting that understanding this evolution can provide insights for designing intelligent systems.
